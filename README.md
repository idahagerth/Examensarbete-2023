# Good News Around The World
#### The main purpose of my App “Good News! For me, and other users, to get some positive and fun information that has happened around the world, I got my idea from reading the “regular” news and thinking that I rarely see happy news. 

<br>

#### I know that good things are also happening around the world, And that changes are happening! That almost never gets mentioned.

<br>

#### I feel so much more inspired everyday reading good news and that there is hope for the future, even when it feels really shitty. 
 
<br>

### This is my "Master Thesis" for my frontend / App development education that started in 2021. It's an app that shows good news around the world. Enjoy!

<br>

### Modules I used for this project:
* Axios:
  * I used Axios to craft an API requests from Reddit`s API, I chose axios because I have the most experience with that module, as we used it in previous projects.
* Bootstrap:
  * With good responsive development of mobile-first websites, Bootstrap provided me a collection of "easy use" design templates for me to choose between for my project.
* Framer-motion:
  * Was great to use for complex CSS animations for my website,that allowed me to make my text & pictures "float in" or "Ease-In"
* React:
  * Building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript. In React, you develop your applications by creating reusable components that you can think of as independent Lego blocks. I chose to use React because we learned it in the course and it is also the industry standard.
* React-bootstrap:
  * It creates ready-made React components using the bootstrap framework. Styling is included so I don't have to mess around with vanilla CSS. 
* React-icons:
  * They have all the icons I want for my App.
* React-router-bootstrap:
  * Used for Bootstrap components to be compatible with "React Router" for exampel my "LinkContainer" component wraps Bootstrap "Navlink".
* React-router-dom:
  * React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL. I learned it in the course and it very nice and clean to use.

#### My “work process” for this webpage was to first, Find a working API that was open source for me to use, And that was Reddit. 
#### Once I got the API working and had all the information I needed. I started with the basics:
 * Layout
 * Amount of pages
 * Navbar
 * Footer
 * And a “paginator” so users don't need to scroll the page

<br>

#### After the groundwork was added,I styled it with colors & fonts and my goal was for it to be very user friendly and easy to use. 

<br>

The last part of the project was to make it mobile friendly.
I have applied all the knowledge & techniques I have learned from all my courses since starting in 2021. 
#### For the “future” or development for this App, Could be to expand the API request and use different sources and add more good news stories.
